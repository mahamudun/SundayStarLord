Java Assignment - 5 

1. Write a method that returns the largest integer in the list. You can assume that the list has at least one element.
2. Write a method that returns 'Fizz' for multiples of three and 'Buzz' for the multiples of five.
         For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return 'FizzBuzz'.
 	For numbers that are neither, return the input number.
3. A palindrome is a word which reads the same backward or forward. 'abcba' is a palindrome.
 	Write a method that detects if a string is a palindrome.
 	Tip: Use word.charAt(i) to get the character at position i.
4. The Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Ceasar to securely communicate with his generals. Each letter is replaced by another letter N positions down the english alphabet. For example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'. In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates and it is transformed into a 'd'.
	Implement a decoder for the Ceasar cipher where N = 5.
 	TIP: Use code.toCharArray() to get an array of characters.
